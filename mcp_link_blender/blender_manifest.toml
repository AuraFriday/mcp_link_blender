⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING ⚠️

This extension gives AI agents COMPLETE, UNRESTRICTED access to:
- The ENTIRE Python API (bpy.ops, bpy.data, bpy.context, bpy.types)
- Arbitrary Python code execution via exec()
- File system read/write operations
- Network operations and system commands
- All loaded add-ons and global application state

THE AI CAN DO ANYTHING YOU CAN DO - including deleting files, accessing private data, 
making network requests, and executing system commands. There are NO restrictions.

⚠️ ONLY USE IF YOU TRUST THE MCP SERVER AND AI AGENTS COMPLETELY ⚠️

This extension is intended for:
- Developers who understand the security implications
- Controlled environments where the MCP server is trusted
- AI-assisted automation where security is managed externally

DO NOT USE THIS if you do not understand what arbitrary code execution means.

---

How it works:
- Connects to a local MCP-Link server via HTTP/SSE
- Registers as a remote tool that AI agents can discover and control
- Receives commands from AI and executes them with full privileges
- Uses bpy.app.timers for thread-safe main-thread execution

Capabilities:
- Execute arbitrary Python code with bpy, mathutils, and all standard libraries
- Direct API calls to any bpy.ops operator or bpy.data accessor
- Call other MCP tools (databases, browsers, user interfaces) from within Python
- Persistent Python sessions that maintain variables across calls

Technical notes:
- Network threads handle MCP communication (no Blender API calls from threads)
- All Blender API calls are queued and executed on the main thread via bpy.app.timers
- This is the standard Blender-recommended pattern for background operations
